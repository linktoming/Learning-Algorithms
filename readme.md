Algorithms Learning
===================

This repo is for me to learn algorithms.

## Table of Content

### Sorting
- Insertion sort

### Dynamic Programming
- Fibonacci number

### Recursive
- Fibonacci number



## Notes to Reader
- In real projects, adding categories to NSArray or other alike classes to provide addtional funcionalities such as sorting may be considered a voilation the single resposiblity princile in software engineering. However, in the context of practicing algorithms in Objective-C, categrories provide a convenient and concise way for the implementation such as accessing elements in a data set or setting up the scaffolding code.
