Algorithms Learning
===================

My notes and code for learning algorithms

## Notes to Reader
- In real projects, adding categories to NSArray or other alike classes to provide addtional funcionalities such as sorting may be considered a voilation the single resposiblity princile in software engineering. However, in the context of practicing algorithms in Objective-C, categrories provide a convenient and concise way for the implementation such as accessing elements in a data set or setting up the scaffolding code.
