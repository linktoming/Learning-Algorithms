MMAlgorithms
===================

This repo is mainly for me to practice algorithms.

## Progress

###Sorting
- Insertion Sort

## Notes to Reader
- In real projects, adding categories to NSArray or other alike classes to provide addtional funcionalities such as sorting may be considered a voilation the single resposiblity princile in software engineering. However, in the context of practicing algorithms in Objective-C, categrories provide a convenient and concise way for the implementation such as accessing elements in a data set or setting up the scaffolding code.
